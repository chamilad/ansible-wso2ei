# WSO2 Ansible Playbooks

> This is my personal effort on getting started with Ansible. This is NOT an official WSO2 provided Playbook.

WSO2 Ansible Playbooks provide Ansible artifacts that can be used to configure WSO2 products.

# TODO
1. Setup databases and template datasources
2. Write for other EI runtimes
3. Write for Identity Server
4. Write for a C5 product (API Manager 3.0)
